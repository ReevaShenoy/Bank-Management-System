# Bank-Management-System
This project is built upon the connectivity between Python (frontend) and MySQL (backend), and gives the user the freedom to perform simple bank operations such as deposit money, withdraw money, check balance, forgot password, etc.

The database used in this programme is REALPROJECT. The two tables CUST and BANKDETAILS, connected by a foreign key, contain the data.
